# Android Plugin for Gradle cookbook

This repository contains ready-to-use recipes for common build 
customizations that showcase the Android Gradle plugin's public APIs and DSL.

The top level folder represents different ways to use the APIs:
- From Groovy-based `build.gradle` files
- From Kotlin-based `build.gradle.kts` files
- From `buildSrc`

The Master branch currently represents the state of AGP 4.1.
